What is DataBricks

    Databricks is a managed data and analytics platform developed by the same people responsible for creating Spark.  It's a platform where you can run ApacheSpark

What makes DataBricks Unique?
-----------------------------

    Not only does Databricks sit on top of either an Azure or AWS flexible, distributed cloud computing environment, it also masks the complexities of distributed processing from your data scientists and engineers, allowing them to develop straight in Spark's native R, Scala, Python or SQL interface.
